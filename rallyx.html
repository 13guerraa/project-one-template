                <h1 class="how-to-play-rallyx">How To Play</h1>
                <p class="rallyx-intro"> Your only goal is to collect all ten flags as quickly as possible. You need to pay constant attention to two things: the zoomed-in view of the world that occupies the left side and most of the centre of the monitor, and the radar view of the world on the right. The radar view provides you with two key pieces of information: the relative position of the flags in the world (indicated by the yellow dots), and the proximity of the enemy cars (indicated by the red dots) to yours (indicated by the black-white flashing dot). <br> <br>The method you use for collecting the flags is of utmost importance. It is usually best to try to hop from one flag to whichever flag is closest, but the enemies will make that quite difficult to do. As a general rule, you should not reverse your direction unless it is absolutely necessary and completely safe to do so (i.e. when there are no enemy cars behind you, as this will otherwise kill you). If you have to choose between getting close to an enemy car to pick up a nearby flag, and abandoning that flag for a farther flag, you should go for the farther flag. The more distance you put between you and the enemy cars, the safer you will remain in this. In general, you will be safe off if you choose a direction to collect flags, clockwise or counter-clockwise, and stick to it throughout the duration of the stage. However, this technique cannot be relied on in the later stages when more enemy cars start at the top. <br> <br> The smokescreen is an invaluable and incredibly tempting tool to use. But if you use it too much, you will deplete your fuel supply very quickly, making it more likely that you will run out of fuel before you collect all 10 flags, which will almost ensure your demise.
                <br><br>Challenge levels (spelled "CHARANGING STAGE" by the game) occur before each stage change, which occurs upon the third stage and every fourth stage thereafter. In these stages, you are free to collect all of the flags without being harassed by enemy cars until your fuel runs out. However, you can still crash into parked cars and rocks, so you must still be careful.</p>
